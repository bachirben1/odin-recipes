    <h1>Fish Puttanesca</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fish puttanesca, served over spaghetti, comes together quickly. Normally, puttanesca sauce, simple but robust, doesn’t include a protein, but it’s easy to add some cod filets, and 
        the addition barely influences the cooking time. Any mild white fish will be just fine in this dish.</p>

         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>1/2 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons drained capers</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon anchovy paste, or to taste</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat until it shimmers.</li>
            <li>Add capers, anchovy paste, garlic, and red pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic is soft and fragrant, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain off about 1/2 cup of the liquid in the tomato can and discard. With clean hands, crush tomatoes, and add to the skillet with the remaining juice. </li>
         </ol>
